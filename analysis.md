# Restaurant Profitability Analysis - Full Walkthrough

## Question: From the given data, make predictions on why this restaurant is losing money

---

## Step 1: Initial Data Assessment

Looking over the information listed, I can already find some discrepancies in the data.

- **a.** The database is messy, and encoded. It will be tricky to access all information, the database will need to be updated, and personalized later.

- **b.** There's a lot of low cost items on the menu which should be leading to higher profits

---

## Step 2: Database Setup

First, I will convert the database into a database editor to continue, I chose "DB Browser for SQLite"

---

## Step 3: Profit Margin Analysis

Second I will use a join query to calculate three things:

- **a.** The total cost to make the recipe
- **b.** The gross profit of the menu item
- **c.** The profit margin for each dish (based on ingredients excluding labor)

**Query:** [`01_profit_margin_analysis.sql`](sql/01_profit_margin_analysis.sql)

**Finding:** [`01_profit_margin_analysis.csv`](results/01_profit_margin_analysis.csv)

- **a.** I can see that the Salad and pizza menu items are outliers, losing more money than other menu items. Though it isn't necessarily bad, as long as those items sell a lot.

---

## Step 4: Sales Volume Analysis

I'll use this query to check total amounts of each item sold (I also included the average price per order but later saw the information was of no value):

**Query:** [`02_quantity_and_revenue.sql`](sql/02_quantity_and_revenue.sql)

**Finding:** [`02_quantity_and_revenue.csv`](results/02_quantity_and_revenue.csv)

- **a.** I can see once again Salad is an outlier. It is one of the lowest selling items on the menu. I can also see Pizza is the best seller, meaning this is not the root cause for the loss of money.

- **b.** I can see salad is an outlier, but why?

---

## Step 5: Salad Ingredient Cost Breakdown

I will use this union-join query to see what ingredients cost most:

**Query:** [`03_salad_cost_breakdown.sql`](sql/03_salad_cost_breakdown.sql)

**Finding:** [`03_salad_cost_breakdown.csv`](results/03_salad_cost_breakdown.csv)

- **a.** I can see now Parmesan is the highest cost ingredient by sixty-five cents. Due to the salad being one of the lowest ordered items, and the high cost of the parmesan i believe this menu item is the cause for the loss of money

---

## Step 6: Recommendations - Salad Optimization

**Regardless, start marketing the salad. Put up larger menu displays and posters to draw attention to the low sold menu/high cost menu item**

- **i.** Either, reduce amount of parmesan per salad by 1 oz, saving 62 cents per order. Consider adding more of lower cost ingrediants such as tomateos or olives.

- **ii.** Or, look into changing the vinaigrette for a new parmesan dressing. Getting rid of the need for parmesan on the salad entirely. Depending on the new cost of the new dressing, this would save around one dollar per salad. And can be labeled as a new menu item for an event.

**Doing these steps could save 100-200$ per week. This is good but perhaps theres more im missing**

---

## Step 7: Total Profit Contribution Analysis

I'm going to go back to my original thought, the low cost menu items should be generating plenty of profit. I will use another union-join query to do many tasks here:

- **a.** List the menu item
- **b.** menu cost
- **c.** cost to make and gross profit
- **d.** Count total quantity sold
- **e.** calculate its total profit contribution to search for discrepancies

**Query:** [`04_profit_contribution.sql`](sql/04_profit_contribution.sql)

**Finding:** [`04_profit_contribution.csv`](results/04_profit_contribution.csv)

- **a.** I can see from the chart theres a discrepancy from the low profit items. The low profit items are generating low total profit.
  - **i.** The mains are selling extremely well, the sides and desserts are shaky
  - **ii.** Ice cream, fries and salad are losing the most
    - Ice cream has a high cost and low total quantity sold
    - Fries have a high quantity sold but low gross per item
    - Salad has already been touched on

---

## Step 8: Top vs Bottom Performers Comparison

I'll write another querey to:
- **a.** calculate the combined profit and total orders of the top 4 sellers and bottom 4 sellers
- **b.** Averages the price per order

This query is a continuation of the '04_profit_contribution.sql' querey. this will combine the top and bottom 4 sellers making it easy to see the profit differences.

**Query:** [`05_top_bottom_performer.sql`](sql/05_top_bottom_performer.sql)

**Finding:** [`05_top_bottom_performer.csv`](results/05_top_bottom_performer.csv)
- **a.** I can see theres no problem with the amount of orders, just the amount of profit generated by each item. The difference between the top and bottom 4.
  - **i.** The difference is 4,000$ or 60%. this is a massive descripency.

- **b.** Upping the prices or removing the items would be my first recommendation, but these are common items where both would be difficult to do without receiving backlash

- **c.** My second thought is to introduce a discounted bundling system where customers can order more food at a slightly discounted price.
  - **i.** Burger and fries
  - **ii.** Pasta and salad
  - **iii.** Pizza and icecream

---

## Step 9: Bundle Discount Strategy Analysis

The discounted bundling system seems like a valid option. Though it is very vauge, so let me narrow it down. Either a full discount for both items, or simply just a discount on the side/dessert.

I'll write one final querey to calculate a few tasks:
- **a.** Menu price and profit from 10% off both menu items
- **b.** Meny price and profit from 20% off the side/dessert item
- **c.** The normal profit if a customer were to only purchase a main item

**Query:** [`06_discount_options.sql`](sql/06_discount_options.sql)

**Finding:** [`06_discount_options.csv`](results/06_discount_options.csv)

## Final Recommendations:

### Short-Term Win
As a short win, change the salad recipe to include less parmesan. Consider adding more lower cost ingredients such as tomatoes or olives as a substitute

### Long-Term Strategy
Long term, rework the menu to include combo bundles. These bundles should include a high sold/high profit item, with a lesser sold/less profit margin item. And placing a 20% discount on the cheaper item will lead to more item sales and higher profits overall without changing the menu or switching around any labor.
